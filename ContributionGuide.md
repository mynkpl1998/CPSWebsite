# Introdution

This purpose of this guide is to explain the conventions and rules which are needed to followed to keep the this website maintainable while keeping the effort minimal.

# Code Structure

There are two branches.
* master (production branch)
* dev (development branch)

**master** branch is the code which is deployed and consumed by the end user. As, it is a production level branch very few people have the privileges to directy push their code in it. This is done to prevent the bad code being pushed into the deployed website.
Currently [Mayank](https://github.com/mynkpl1998) and [Sanjit](https://github.com/skkaul) have the rights to this branch.

**dev** branch is the one of which most of you have access to write. Whatever changes you make is needed to be pushed into the dev branch and then submit a merge request to merge your code into the master. Based upon the code quality, whether it breaks the existing code or not, your request might get rejected.
